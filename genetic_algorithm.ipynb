    "<h4>Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are adaptive heuristic methods that belong to the broader category of evolutionary algorithms. They are inspired by the principles of natural selection and genetics, using intelligent exploration of random searches combined with past data to guide the search towards areas of higher performance within the solution space. GAs are frequently employed to produce high-quality solutions for optimization and search problems.</h4>\n",

    "<h5>1.Individuals in a population compete for resources and opportunities to reproduce.</h5>\n",
    "<h5>2.The most successful (fittest) individuals have a higher chance of reproducing, passing on their genetic material.</h5>\n",
    "<h5>3.The fittest parents' genes are propagated through the population, sometimes resulting in offspring that surpass both parents in fitness.</h5>\n",
    "<h5>4.Consequently, each generation becomes increasingly better suited to its environment.</h5>"

    "Algorithm Steps\n",
    "1. Initialization<br>\n",
    "The genetic algorithm begins with the generation of an initial population of individuals, which are potential solutions to the problem. Each individual is represented by a set of parameters known as genes, which can be encoded as binary strings, real-valued numbers, or other data types. The population is typically generated randomly to ensure diversity.\n",
    "2. Fitness Evaluation<br>\n",
    "Each individual in the population is evaluated using a fitness function, which quantifies how well it solves the problem at hand. The fitness score determines the likelihood of an individual being selected for reproduction in the next generation. Higher fitness scores increase the chances of selection, simulating the \"survival of the fittest\" principle.\n",
    "3. Selection<br>\n",
    "Individuals are selected from the current population based on their fitness scores. Various selection methods can be employed, such as roulette wheel selection, tournament selection, or rank-based selection. The goal is to choose individuals that will serve as parents for the next generation, thereby passing on their genes.\n",
    "4. Crossover (Recombination)<br>\n",
    "In this step, selected parents are paired to produce offspring through a process called crossover. This involves exchanging segments of their genetic information to create new individuals. Crossover mimics sexual reproduction and introduces genetic diversity into the population.\n",
    "5. Mutation<br>\n",
    "Mutation introduces random changes to the genes of some individuals in the population. This step is crucial for maintaining genetic diversity and preventing premature convergence on suboptimal solutions. Mutation can involve flipping bits in a binary representation or altering values in a real-valued representation.\n",
    "6. Replacement<br>\n",
    "After generating new offspring through crossover and mutation, the algorithm replaces the old population with the new one. This can be done in various ways, such as replacing the entire population or using elitism, where the best individuals from the previous generation are retained.\n",
    "7. Termination<br>\n",
    "The algorithm repeats the evaluation, selection, crossover, mutation, and replacement steps for a predefined number of generations or until a termination condition is met. Common termination criteria include achieving a satisfactory fitness level, reaching a maximum number of generations, or observing no significant improvement over several generations"
